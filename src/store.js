// The `store()` module is a mechanism to store an immutable object that represents state of an application. Any application may have one or more active stores, so there's no limitation from how you use the data. The store itself provides four methods: `state()`, `dispatch(reducer, state)`, `to(cb)`, `remove(cb)`.
//
// 1. The `store.state()` returns a clone of the internal state object, which is simply a pure copy of JSON of the data. Since this uses pure JSON representation in-lieue of actual Tries and immutable data libraries, this keeps the code footprint tiny, but you can only store pure JSON data in the store.
// 2. The `store.to(cb)` will register `cb` as a callback function, invoking `cb(nextState)` whenever the store's state is updated with `store.dispatch()` (`store.remove(cb)` simply does the opposite, removing the callback from the list of event listeners).
// 3. The biggest method implemented by `store()` is `store.dispatch(reducer, state=store.state())`. By default, the second parameter is the existing state of the `store`, but you can override the state object input, if need be. The key here is the redux-inspired `reducer`, which is a function that **you** write that receives two arguments, `state` and `next()`. You should modify the state object somehow, or create a copy, and pass it into `next(state)` to trigger an update to be sent to listener. For example:
//
//     ```js
//     const logger = (state) => console.log('state changed! -->', state)
//     store.to(logger)
//
//     store.distpatch((state, next) => {
//         setTimeout(() => {
//             let timestamp = +new Date
//             next({ ...state, timestamp })
//         }, 2000)
//     })
//     ```
